Unity Virtual Hand Model for [WBA Capstone](https://github.com/utepe/Capstone) 2023

The Virtual Hand Model is a hand model constructed in Unity that can be used in virtual reality applications. It was created using the Unity game engine and the Oculus Integration package. It was designed to be used with the WBA project to visualize the user's hand movements in a virtual environment in order to test and validate the control glove's calibration. It also acts as a controller for the WBA device in order to cycle between different modes of the device.
